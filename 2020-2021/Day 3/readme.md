# Technical Interview / ICPC Practice Session: Day Three (***Saturday Oct/24 8PM - 9:30PM / 11:00PM***)

## Introduction
We love Google Search. But before we can implement its algorithm, we need to know what is some more basic formats of searching algorithms. So, that is **Breadth-first Search**, **Depth-first Search**, and **Union Find Search**

## Sample Problems
Problems reviewed during this week's practice session:

### Lexicographically Smallest String After Applying Operations (Median - Breadth-first Search)
https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-smallest-string-after-applying-operations/  
### Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum (Hard - Depth-first Search)
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/  
### Graph Connectivity With Threshold (Hard - Union Find Search)
https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-connectivity-with-threshold/  

# Then?
After the session, for those of you who are interested, let's do a live competition on https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-212. ***We don't cheat!***
