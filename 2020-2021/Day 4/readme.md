# Technical Interview / ICPC Practice Session: Day Four (***Saturday Oct/31 8PM - 9:30PM[^1]***)

## Introduction
Let's DP, cuz we are lazy. No need for repeated work, also, no need for more introduction.

## Sample Problems
Problems reviewed during this week's practice session:

### LeetCode
#### Best Team With No Conflicts (Median - Dynamic Programming)
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-team-with-no-conflicts/  
#### Interleaving String (Hard - Dynamic Programming)
https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/  

### Kattis

[^1]: Hopefully we can finish before 9:30PM so that we can do LeetCode weekly competition real-time as practice.
[^2]: Harder than hard in terms of LeetCode standards, median for competitions. Harder are more interesting ones! Hope you enjoy it.
