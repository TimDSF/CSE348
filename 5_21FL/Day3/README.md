# LeetCode / ICPC Session: Day 3 (***Saturday Oct/9***)

## Topics
_once upon a time - Fibonacci_  
Fibonacci sequence is famous for multiple reasons. In case you are unfamiliar with it, it is a sequence that starts with `1` and `1`; then, iteratively, we have each number being the sum of the previous two. Specifically, we have

```math
	1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, \cdots
```

How many ways can you calculate the n<sup>th</sup> number of the Fibonacci sequence?
