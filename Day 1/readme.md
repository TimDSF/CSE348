Technical Interview / ICPC Practice Session: Day One

Have you ever imagined to use Dynamic Programming on a circular interval to be the fastest in run time (of a track)? Do you ever dream of implementing Greedy Algorithm to gain the maximum available money available (as a traveling salesman)? It is all fake! But they are real when doing technical interviews. If you do, then come to the ACM practice session on Saturday. Link to the Github page, with handouts and syllabus: https://github.com/TimDSF/CSE348_AlgorithmNonAnalysis.
