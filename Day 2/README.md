# Technical Interview / ICPC Practice Session: Day Two (***Saturday Mar/21 12PM - 3PM***)

Today is the day for being ***Greedy*** (and ***Divide***d ***and Conquer***ed). 

***(1)*** We will ***first*** talk about the ***USACO*** problem that can only be found on ***POJ*** (USACO is greedy, they don't want to put too much problems on their server), a website that lost funding for years (Peking University is greedy to think that students can win world champion without their own online judge).  
***(2)*** Then, the one problem on ***MCPC19***, for I am greedy to spend the least amount of time to talk about the most problems.  
***(3)*** Finally, from this week's ***Codeforces: Kotlin Heroes*** problems that are stolen purely from previous ***CF*** contests, again showing that programmers are greedy (or lazy).  

Problems reviewed during this week's practice session:
