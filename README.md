# CSE348_AlgorithmNonAnalysis

This is the official git repository of **Computer Science and Engineering 348: Algorithm NonAnalysis course funded by Association for Computing Machinery of Washington University in St. Louis** for the aim of preparing for ___International Collegiate Programming Contest___, also known as ___CSE348:ANA_WUACM_ICPC___, whatever that means.

However, this is also the best source for preparing for **Technical Interviews** because we will cover different _solution paradigms_, _data structures_, and _optimizations_ that helps you solve **Interview Problems** with less time and better performance.

For practicing in your own time, we recommend https://codeforces.com for more competitive problems. https://open.kattis.com and https://leetcode.com are also good sources for a more balanced practice between ___competitive___ and ___interview___.
