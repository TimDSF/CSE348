# CSE348_AlgorithmNonAnalysis

## Introduction (trivial)
This is the official git repository of **Computer Science and Engineering 348: Algorithm NonAnalysis course “funded” by Association for Computing Machinery of Washington University in St. Louis**, preparing for ___International Collegiate Programming Contest___, also known as ___CSE348:ANA_WUACM_ICPC___.  

However, this is also the best source for preparing for **Technical Interviews** because we will cover different _solution paradigms_, _data structures_, and _optimizations_ that helps you solve **Interview Problems** with less time and better performance.

For practicing in your own time, we recommend https://codeforces.com for more ___competitive___ problems. https://open.kattis.com and https://leetcode.com are also good sources for a more balanced practice between ___competitiveness___ and ___interview___.
